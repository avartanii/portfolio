###3D Models

These are various 3D Models I have created completely by myself. I took an intro to AutoCAD course in my senior year of high school. The curriculum was quite simple, but I was able to use the small push start to develop my skills to develop the models found here.

- Catapult: A model of a small catapult built from 2x4 planks and PVC that was used in a physics project and achieved the highest score.

- Chair: A model of a desk chair I created for my AutoCAD course. While everyone was using rectangles I was able to create smooth contoured surfaces such as those found here.

- Desk: This was for an assignment in my AutoCAD course. We were supposed to design our ideal school desk. My high school was about to adapt iPad usage for students, so I made my desk relevant to that idea. There is a power outlet on the right leg, the left and right sides of the first two-thirds of the desktop can be propped up (much like how a pool deck chair works) to create a stand for iPads (or books) to allow students to read comfortably while still keeping the teacher in their peripheral vision. The chair can also be stacked on top of the desk (the bottom of the seat (not legs) resting on the desktop, supported the the iPad stand), making it easier for custodial workers to do their job after students leave.

- Hydroflask Cap: A good friend of mine had one of these popular water bottles (https://www.hydroflask.com/hydration) and had a Tile tracker looped around the top (https://www.thetileapp.com/). I thought that weird (since someone could just take the Tile off) and decided to create this. This is a Hydroflask Cap with a cavity that perfectly fits a Tile Tracker. I measured the dimensions of the original cap with a ruler and eye-balling, estimating where I needed to add or subtract a millimeter or two. I 3D printed it and it fit perfectly. I am pretty proud of this model.

- Lightsaber Mounts: This is still in progress. Two of these are to be used to mount a Force FX Lightsaber on a wall.

###Java

These are two different projects. FiniteAutomata is a personal assignment I did for fun for my professor in our Theory of Computation course. KirkmanSolver was an assignment from our Algorithms course.

- FiniteAutomata: This program takes in a Definitive Finite Automata and determines whether strings passed in by the user are accepted or rejected by the machine.

- AdvancedChangeMaker: This program takes in coin denominations and an amount and presents the most efficient collection of coins that will add up to the given amount.
  - For example: Given the denominations (1, 4, 5) and an amount 8, the solution will propose using two 4-cent coins as opposed to one 5-cent and three 1-cent coins).
  - Tuple.java is written for this program only.
  
- ArbINTrary: Allows calculations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulo) of arbitrarily sized integers.

- ChangeMaker: A simple changemaker that greedily (not efficiently) makes change.
  - Given the prior example, this would output the second solution.
  
- DateCounter: Simple calendar related functions such as checking if a year is a leap year, returns the number of days in a month, if a year has a leap second, and the number of days between two given dates.

- KirkmanSolver: This is a solution to Kirkman's Schoolgirl Problem.
    
  > The problem states:
    
  >>"Fifteen young ladies in a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily so that no two shall walk twice abreast."                                    

  > The following is my solution to the problem using backtracking. I was able to create the most efficient solution my professor has ever seen (using backtracking). His solution takes 18 million iterations and 2.54 seconds for completion, mine takes 300,000 iterations and .027 seconds.                                                       

  > After seeing my solution, he challenged me to find the solution for a more difficult version that his code would not complete, 28 girls walking 2 abreast (requires a 27 days solution). After fixing a few inefficiencies in my code, it finished in 3 hours. I am very proud of this solution.         

  > Note: I realize there are some "magic numbers" in This solution. That is not my conventional way of writing code. I am in the the process of creating a possible research proposal with my professor to parameterize this problem with n girls walking x abreast. I will be cleaning up this code more so then.

###JS, HTML, CSS

These are three different assignments from our Interaction Design class at LMU

- Direct Manipulation: This is a web page that allows a user to draw, move, resize, and delete boxes on a touchscreen device.

- Reusable Plugin: This is a slider plugin that allows users to implement a slider into their web pages and assign and return specific values.

- Web Front End: This is a custom rough front end development using Imgur's API. It allows users to search Imgur as well as browse the popular Galleries

###Python

These are two different assignments from our Programming Languages class at LMU

- Index: Creates an index of all the words of passed .txt files that can be referenced by various commands.

- SimpleQuery: Allows users to make queries about data found in passed .csv files
